## First step.

Make sure all the devices are powered on.
You may have two power supplies, one to power your home wifi router and a second to power the poe which in turn power the device(s) on the roof.

If you have only a Wifi router, then make sure it is powered and connected to the Ethernet cable coming from the roof.
If you also have a poe (power over ethernet), make sure the right power supply power the right device. The power supply are not interchangeable. They may have different Voltage and if plugged to the wrong device they may damage that device.  

When you test your connection. Connect your computer directly, using an ethernet patch cable, to the router, to bypass the wifi, or directly to the poe bypassing the router altogether. You want to test the connection first, not the router nor the Wifi. An Ethernet connection is faster than a WiFi connection,

## Your Internet and WiFi Speeds
### What Internet speed is required for your activities?

Several factors can affect your internet performance: WiFi router location, number of users, the hardware and age of your device(s), the device software, and any applications running in the background.

There is a wrong perception that Internet services require a lot of bandwidth (speed). Recommended internet speeds for use of third-party products and services depend on the number of devices you're using. See the following speeds required for these common third-party products and services:
<br><br>
-- Streaming HD 10	Mbps

-- Skype Call HD 1.5 Mbps

-- Video Gaming 3.5 Mpbs

-- Twitch Gaming 4.5-6 Mbps

-- Netflix 5 Mbps

-- Amazon Prime HD 15 Mbps
<br><br>
For more informations please refer to those services' website.


### WiFi Router Location

If you’re connecting to the Internet via WiFi, make sure your router is placed as close to the middle of your home as possible, away from obstructions (such as cabinets) away from other electronic devices and off the floor.
Wall, metal plate (air-vent), refrigerators or microwave ovens, reduce signal if not block it totally. Other electronic devices (microwave, TV, babymonitor, etc...) can create interferences.  Wi-Fi doesn’t do well around lots of water, either, so stay away from 100-gallon aquariums.

### Wifi band

Wifi routers operate in different frequencies. The 5 GHz wireless frequency provides faster data rates at shorter distances and is typically much less busy than the 2.4 GHz wireless frequency. If wireless range is your priority, 2.4 GHz performs better than 5 GHz. But 2.4 Ghz is more subject to interferences. 5 GHz wireless frequency doesn’t penetrate solid objects nearly as well as the 2.4 GHz wireless frequency.
A dual band router 2.4/5 Ghz usually perform better than a mono band 2.4Ghz router as your device (smartphone, laptop) picks up the best signal, 2.4 or 5 Ghz.

Note: the 5GHz band has nothing to do with 5G cellular service. 2 differents things, the latest refers to 5th Generation.

### Wifi channels

Wifi operates on different channels (like cars on different lanes on a highway). Your neighbor's router may operate on the same channel as your router, creating congestions. Try to change your router Wifi channel. There are app that can scan the channels and tell you which is the less occupied. Channel occupation, just like road traffic, depends on time of day and may change from one day to the other, as your neighbors may just do the same, change channel.  


### Test the performance
It is a good idea to always use the same tool to test to be able to compare. We use [speedtest.com](https://www.speedtest.net/) against Pilot, NY.
