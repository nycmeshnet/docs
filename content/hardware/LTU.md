Ubiquiti has a new "technology" which is the successor to [AirMax](https://dl.ubnt.com/datasheets/airmax/UBNT_DS_airMAX_TDMA.pdf) , called [LTU](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002759393-LTU-Frequently-Asked-Questions). 
(more about [AirMax](https://dl.ubnt.com/AirMax_ppt.pdf) )

LTU and AirMax are not compatible. You need a different device/antenna to connect to the LTU sector. 

We have one LTU sector mounted on the west side of [1340-Saratoga](/nodes/node-1340/).  Try it. <br><br>
Here the approximate coverage.<br><br>

<br><br>
The sector is a [LTU-Rocket](https://www.ui.com/products/#ltu) radio and a [AM-5ac21-60](https://www.ui.com/airmax/airmax-ac-sector-antenna/) antenna. 
It is positioned about 260o azimut, and it's a 60o angle.

We have one node using that new LTU sector right now. [944-Flo](https://www.nycmesh.net/map/nodes/944) 
It uses a [LTU LR](https://www.ui.com/products/#ltu) antenna and so far is better with a more stable bandwidth then the Litebeam Gen2 to a LiteAP it was using before.
